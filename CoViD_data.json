But if that’s not an option, it’s perfectly acceptable to express your concerns to your supervisor or HR team. You could simply say, “I know John is working hard, but it seems like he’s not feeling very well. Is it possible to ask him to work from home until he’s no longer running a fever or coughing? I’m concerned about him infecting others in the office.”\n\nThese can feel like awkward conversations to have. But it’s the job of leadership and HR teams to provide a safe work environment to all employees—and they’re trained to address thorny issues like these.",

The number of tests and testing sites available are rapidly increasing. Still, it will take weeks before the test is available to everyone who may be infected. Meanwhile, clinicians will primarily test those with respiratory symptoms who have recently traveled to certain countries, live in a community with many infected people, or likely have been exposed to someone known to have COVID-19. Call the State Helpline Number or Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India's 24x7 helpline 011-2397 8046. If one qualifies as a case for testing as per the protocol, they would be tested at a Government approved lab only.",

        "Answer": "There is a strong evidence that it can be transmitted by people who are just mildly ill or even presymptomatic.
